# Human histories shape the biodiversity data that decide our future

While rapidly growing repositories of biodiversity data provide unprecedented insight into ecological patterns at global scales, the application of species observations often belies the reality that the species these data tell us most about is the one they were never intended to include: humans. Biodiversity data trace not only cities and roads but the rise of surveillance technology, shadows of colonial histories, and echoes of contemporary racial and economic disparities. However, these same data are increasingly used as the starting point to inform the implementation of global policy and the investment of billions of dollars to protect and restore nature over the next decade. Effectively leveraging large-scale biodiversity data to benefit both people and nature requires expertise in social, cultural, and political processes underlying data infrastructures and their histories, just as much as it requires more data and increasingly complex statistical methods.
